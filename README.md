# Credit-card-fraud-detection
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using supervised machine learning techniques — Decision Trees and Support Vector Machines (SVM). It leverages real-world anonymized data and tackles the challenge of imbalanced classification.
📌 Key Features
✅ Uses the Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset

📊 Visualizes class imbalance and feature correlations

⚙️ Preprocesses data with StandardScaler and normalization

🌲 Trains a Decision Tree Classifier with class weighting

💻 Implements a Linear SVM for binary classification

📈 Evaluates models using ROC-AUC score

🧠 Tools & Libraries
pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn

🧪 Objective
To compare the performance of Decision Trees vs. SVMs in identifying fraudulent transactions under heavily skewed class distributions.
